## Production Features

- Public arbitrage access site with a server-validated setup wizard
- Account activation after project submission
- Role-aware client and staff workspace
- Setup milestones, messaging, document delivery, client requests, and appointments
- Signed Cloudinary file uploads
- Stripe Checkout with verified, idempotent webhooks
- PostgreSQL persistence and project-level authorization
- Liveness endpoint at `/api/health` and database readiness at `/api/ready`

## Current Product Direction

YP Labs is now positioned as one unified Arbo + Equity arbitrage access platform. The public site and wizard intentionally remove separate service-cart tracks and route every user into one access plan:

- **One access price:** `$997`
- **One setup path:** beginner-friendly wizard followed by workspace onboarding
- **Education categories:** brokers, exchanges, crypto venues, trading pairs, and equity markets
- **Purpose:** help users understand what they are connecting to, how the categories differ, and what readiness steps are needed before activation

## Quick Start (Local Dev)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/yp-labs.git
cd yp-labs
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, and other required values
```

### 4. Set up the database
Create a PostgreSQL database on [Supabase](https://supabase.com) or [Neon](https://neon.tech), then run:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f docs/schema.sql
```

### 5. Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

The server serves the static HTML files from `/public` at `/` and mounts all API routes under `/api/`.

## Deployment (Railway)

### One-time setup
1. Create a Railway project at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Add a PostgreSQL service in Railway and copy the connection string to `DATABASE_URL`
3. Add all required environment variables from `.env.example` to Railway's environment settings
4. Add your Railway token as a GitHub secret named `RAILWAY_TOKEN`

### Automated deploys
Every push to `main` that passes tests automatically deploys to Railway via the GitHub Actions workflow.
